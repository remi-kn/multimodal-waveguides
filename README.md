# multimodal-waveguides
A repository to share code for the simulation of waveguide acoustics using the multimodal method.

The multimodal method is a powerful simulation method based on the decomposition of the physical fields
on a modal basis. This kind of modal decomposition brings physical insights and is very effective for increasing the 
efficiency of many different numerical methods.
In the context of waveguides, it takes advantage of the elongated shape to express the wavefield as a summation of the transverse modes.

The purpose of this repository is to share code to improve the collaboration in the community interested in this method. 
For example, this can be helpful for people who want to get started, to share an implementation of a specific problem, or provide 
material for students.
